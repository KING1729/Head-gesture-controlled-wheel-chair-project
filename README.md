# Head-gesture-controlled-wheel-chair-project
Head Gesture controlled model Wheel Chair by Sharath Kumar Reddy and Dipayan Das

This project helps in easy motion of patients with phocomeila and other paralysis problems.
They can move as per their wish, just with their head gestures.

We use MPU6050(Accelerometer+gyroscope) to detect change in angles and rotation speed.
Accelerometer helps in detecting motion in all 3 dimensions x,y,z.
Gyroscope helps in detecting speed of motion and angles.
We use Arduino microcontroller to analyze the signals from MPU6050.
We code the arduino in such a way, for particular motors rotation and speed.
Hence the wheels  work accordingly.
